### Background

Berlin is the capital and largest city of Germany by both area (30,000 sq. km) and population
(ca. 3.8 million).

Being world city of culture, politics, media and science, Berlin attracts many tourists all year
round. In 2014, the city recorded 28.7 million overnight hotel stays and 11.9 million hotel
guests. Moreover, tourism figures have more than doubled within the last ten years and Berlin
has become the third most visited city destination in Europe. The largest visitor groups are
from Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the United States.

Additionally, in 2019, Berlin was ranked 13th in the Quality of living city ranking prepared by
Mercer.

### Problem

Being a well known cosmopolitan city with people from all around the world, Berlin offers a
wide variety in the gastronomy sector, especially Italian restaurants, with new ones are
opening all the time.

Searching for an optimal location to open an Italian restaurant in Berlin, however, could be
challenging. Although it is logical to think that locations where there are no Italian restaurants,
or at least not many of them, would be better, the problem is that interested customers tend
to prefer popular and busy neighborhoods with many options available to choose from for
them. From an investor point of view, on the one hand that means more movement of people
and therefore more customers, but on the other, higher rents and stronger competition.

### Interest

To analyze locations, ratings, and competition is a plus for those who want to be part of this
industry. Therefore, the project would be perfect fit for investors who wants to open a new
Italian restaurant in the city of Berlin.
