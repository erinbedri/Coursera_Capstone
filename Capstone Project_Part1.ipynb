Although it is logical to think that locations where there are no Italian restaurants, or at least not many of them, would be better, the problem is that interested customers tend to prefer popular and busy neighborhoods with many options available to choose from for them. From an investor point of view, on the one hand that means more movement of people and therefore more customers, but on the other, higher rents and stronger competition. "
